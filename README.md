## Install

```bush
git clone <project>

```

- Open the Project in VSCode
  - Open the Terminal

```bush
npm install (or just npm i).

And wait until it downloads all the packages and finishes.

npm start to Open the Page

The command in the terminal will never finish.

The command should open your browser at http://localhost:8080/.
At this point, you should see the starting markup of the page.
If the page is empty, add some text to the <body> in the src/index.html file.
The text should appear in the browser.

```

## Info

NPM Commands:

- `npm install` installs the project dependencies and runs postinstall.

This creates reference files for pixel-perfect and tests.
- `npm start` runs the server required for development and tests.
- `npm test` runs the linter and tests.
- `npm run lint` runs the linter (code style check).
- `npm run test:only` runs pixel-perfect tests.
- `npm run deploy` publishes the page and test report to gh-pages.
